# Student-Management-System
Student Management System is a web application which can be used for managing the data of a school related to students, teachers, and courses.

The application has 3 user roles: student, teacher, and admin. Each role has access to different pages and operations which is described below:

<ul>
  <li><b>Admin:</b> The admin can add/delete courses, students, and teachers. Furthermore, it can enroll students to courses or remove students from courses. The admin
  can view statistics of the school such as the number of students and teachers at the school.</li>
  <li><b>Student:</b> The student can view all of the courses enrolled. By clicking on each course, the student can view the course details which consist of exam grades and 
  assignments. The student should click on the "mark as completed" button for each assignment he/she completed so that the teacher of the course can 
  track students' assignment status.</li>
  <li><b>Teacher:</b> The teacher can view the student list, create new assignments and view the students' assignment status, and grade exams.</li>
</ul>
